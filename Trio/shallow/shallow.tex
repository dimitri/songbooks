  \beginverse
  I'm falling
  In all the good times,
  I find myself longin' for change
  And in the bad times, I fear myself
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  Tell me something, boy
  Aren't you tired trying to fill that void?
  Or do you need more?
  Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore?
  \endverse

  In all the good times,
  I find myself longing for change
  And in the bad times, I fear myself

  I'm off the deep end,
  Watch as I dive in
  I'll never meet the ground
  Crash through the surface,
  Where they can't hurt us
  We're far from the shallow now
  In the sha-ha, sha-ha-llow
  In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-llow
  In the sha-ha, sha-ha-llow
  We're far from the shallow now
  Oh, ha-ah-ah
  Ah, ha-ah-ah, oh, ah
  Ha-ah-ah-ah
  \endchorus

  \beginchorus
  I'm off the deep end,
  Watch as I dive in
  I'll never meet the ground
  Crash through the surface,
  Where they can't hurt us
  We're far from the shallow now
  \endchorus

  In the sha-ha, sha-ha-llow
  In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-llow
  In the sha-ha, sha-ha-llow
  We're far from the shallow now
