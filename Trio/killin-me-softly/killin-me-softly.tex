  \beginverse
  \[Am7] I heard he \[D]sang a good song,
  \[G]I heard he \[C]had a style
  \[Am7] And so I \[D]came to see him,
  and \[Em]listen for a while \[Em]
  \[Am7]And there he \[D7]was, this young boy,
  \[G] a stranger \[B7]to my eyes

  \textnote{Chorus}

  \beginverse
  I felt all flushed with fever,
  embarrassed by the crowd
  I felt he'd found my letters
  and read each one out loud
  I prayed that he would finish,
  but he just kept right on
  \endverse

  \textnote{Chorus}

  \beginverse
  He sang as if he knew me
  In all my dark despair
  And then he looked right through me
  As if I wasn't there
  And he just kept on singin'
  Singin' clear and strong
  \endverse

  \textnote{Bridge}

  \beginchorus
  Strumming my pain with his fingers
  Singing my life with his words
  Killing me softly with his song
  Killing me softly with his song
  Telling my whole life with his words
  Killing me softly with his song
  \endchorus

  \beginchorus
  He was strummin' my pain
  Yeah, he was singin' my life
  Killing me softly with his song
  Killing me softly with his song
  Tellin' my whole life with his words
  Killing me softly with his song
  \endchorus
