  \beginchorus
  Strumming my pain with his fingers
  Singing my life with his words
  Killing me softly with his song
  Killing me softly with his song
  Telling my whole life with his words
  Killing me softly with his song

  \beginverse
  I heard he sang a good song,
  I heard he had a style
  And so I came to see him,
  and listen for a while
  And there he was, this young boy,
  stranger to my eyes
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
  Strumming my pain with his fingers
  Singing my life with his words
  Killing me softly with his song
  Killing me softly with his song
  Telling my whole life with his words
  Killing me softly with his song
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
  I felt all flushed with fever,
  embarrassed by the crowd
  I felt he'd found my letters
  and read each one out loud
  I prayed that he would finish,
  but he just kept right on
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
  Strumming my pain with his fingers
  Singing my life with his words
  Killing me softly with his song
  Killing me softly with his song
  Telling my whole life with his words
  Killing me softly with his song
  \endchorus
