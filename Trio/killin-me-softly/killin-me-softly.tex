  \[Am7] I heard he \[D]sang a good song,
  \[G]I heard he \[C]had a style
  \[Am7] And so I \[D]came to see him,

  \[Am7]And there he \[D7]was, this young boy,
  \[G] a stranger \[B7]to my eyes

  Strumming my pain with his fingers
  Singing my life with his words
  Killing me softly with his song
  Killing me softly with his song
  Telling my whole life with his words

  \beginverse
  I felt all flushed with fever,
  embarrassed by the crowd
  I felt he'd found my letters
  and read each one out loud
  I prayed that he would finish,
  but he just kept right on
