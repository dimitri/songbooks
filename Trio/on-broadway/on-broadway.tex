  \beginverse
  They say the neon lights are bright on Broadway
  They say there's always magic in the air
  But when you're walking down that street
  And you ain't had enough to eat
  The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  They say the women treat you right on Broadway
  But looking at them just gives me the blues
  'Cause how you gonna make some time
  When all you got is one thin dime
  And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  They say I won't last too long on Broadway
  I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home, they all say
  But they're dead wrong, I know they are
  'Cause I can play this guitar
  And I won't quit til I'm a star on Broadway
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  I won't quit til I'm a star on Broadway
  No, no, no, no
  I won't quit til I'm a star on Broadway
  Do do do do...
  \endverse
