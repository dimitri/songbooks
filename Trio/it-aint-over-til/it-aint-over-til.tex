\beginsong{It Ain’t Over ’til It’s Over}[by={Lenny Kravitz}]

  \beginverse
  Here we are still together
  We are one
  So much time wasted
  Playing games with love
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  So many tears I've cried
  So much pain inside
  But baby, it ain't over 'til it's over
  So many years we've tried
  To keep our love alive
  But baby, it ain't over 'til it's over
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  How many times did we give up
  But we always worked things out
  And all my doubts and fear kept me wondering, yeah
  If I'd always, always be in love
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  So many tears I've cried
  So much pain inside
  But baby, it ain't over 'til it's over
  So many years we've tried
  And kept our love alive
  'Cause baby, it ain't over 'til it's over
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  So many tears I've cried
  So much pain inside
  Baby, it ain't over 'til it's over
  So many years we've tried
  And kept our love alive
  'Cause baby, it ain't over 'til it's over
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  So many tears I've cried
  So much pain inside
  But baby, it ain't over 'til it's over
  So many years we've tried
  To keep our love alive
  'Cause baby, it ain't over 'til it's over (over, over, over)
  \endverse
