  \[Am]Everyone's feelin' pret\[G]ty
  \[F]It's hotter than July\[E]
  \[D]Though the world's full of problems
  They couldn't \[Am]touch us even if they \[G]tried
  \[Am]From the park I hear rhythms\[G],
  \[F]Marley's hot on the box\[E],
  \[D]Tonight there will be a party
  On \[Am]the corner at the end of \[G]the block

  Didn't know you would be jammin' until the break of dawn
  See, nobody ever told you
  That you would be jammin' until the break of dawn
  You would be jammin' and jammin' and jammin' jam oh
  Ha, ha, oh

  They want us to join their fighting
  But our answer today
  Is to let all our worries
  Like the breeze through our fingers slip away
  Peace has come to Zimbabwe
  Third World's right on the one
  Now's the time for celebration
  'Cause we've only just begun
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  Didn't know you
  Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
  See, nobody ever told you
  That you would be jammin' until the break of dawn
  See, nobody ever told you that you
  (We're in the middle of the making's of the master blaster jammin')
  Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
  I know nobody told you that you
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
  But we're jammin', jammin', jammin', jam on
  Ha, ha
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  You ask me am I happy
  Well as matter of fact
  I can say that I'm ecstatic
  'Cause we all just made a pact
  We've agreed to get together
  Joined as children in Jah
  When you're moving in the positive
  Your destination is the brightest star
  \endverse
