\beginsong{Every Breath You Take}[by={The Police}]

  \beginverse
  Every breath you take
  And every move you make
  Every bond you break
  Every step you take
  I'll be watching you
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  Every single day
  And every word you say
  Every game you play
  Every night you stay
  I'll be watching you
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
  Oh, can't you see
  You belong to me?
  How my poor heart aches
  With every step you take?
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
  Every move you make
  And every vow you break
  Every smile you fake
  Every claim you stake
  I'll be watching you
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  Since you've gone, I've been lost without a trace
  I dream at night, I can only see your face
  I look around, but it's you I can't replace
  I feel so cold, and I long for your embrace
  I keep crying, baby, baby please
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
  Oh, can't you see
  You belong to me?
  How my poor heart aches
  With every step you take?
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
  Every move you make
  And every vow you break
  Every smile you fake
  Every claim you stake
  I'll be watching you
  Every move you make
  Every step you take
  I'll be watching you
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  I'll be watching you
  (Every breath you take)
  (Every move you make)
  (Every bond you break)
  (Every step you take) I'll be watching you
  \endverse
