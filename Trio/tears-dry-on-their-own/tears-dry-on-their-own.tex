\beginsong{Tears Dry On Their Own}[by={Amy Winehouse}]

  \beginverse
  All I can ever be to you is a darkness that we know
  And this regret I got accustomed to
  Once it was so right, when we were at our high
  Waiting for you in the hotel at night
  I knew I hadn't met my match, but every moment we could snatch
  I don't know why I got so attached
  It's my responsibility, and you don't owe nothing to me
  But to walk away, I have no capacity
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  He walks away, the sun goes down
  He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)
  And in your way, in this blue shade
  My tears dry on their own
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  I don't understand, why do I stress the man?
  When there's so many bigger things at hand
  We coulda never had it all, we had to hit a wall
  So this is inevitable withdrawal
  Even if I stop wanting you, a perspective pushes through
  I'll be some next man's other woman soon
  I cannot play myself again, I should just be my own best friend
  Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  He walks away, the sun goes down
  He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)
  And in your way, in this blue shade
  My tears dry on their own
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  So we are history, your shadow covers me
  The sky above a blaze
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  He walks away, the sun goes down
  He takes the day, but I'm grown
  And in your way, in this blue shade
  My tears dry on their own
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  I wish I could say "no regrets" and "no emotional debts"
  'Cause as we kissed goodbye, the sun sets
  So we are history, the shadow covers me
  The sky above a blaze that only lovers see
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  He walks away, the sun goes down
  He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)
  And in your way, my blue shade
  My tears dry on their own
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  Whoa, he walks away, the sun goes down
  He takes the day, but I am grown
  And in your way, my deep shade
  My tears dry on their own
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  He walks away, the sun goes down
  He takes the day, but I'm grown
  And in your way, my deep shade
  My tears dry
  \endverse
