  Boy, you cast a bad spell
  A bad spell over me
  You got me ringing like a doorbell
  You got me buzzing like a yellow bee
  Boy, you cast a bad spell
  A bad spell over me
  And when I catch you, you're gonna catch hell
  I'm a get ya in the first degree

  \beginverse
  Boy, you fast as lightning
  Lightning in the rain
  You're kicking sparks like a fuse box
  You been rattling my window panes
  Boy, you cast a bad spell
  A bad spell over me
  You better beware, you better take good care
  I'm a get ya, it's a guarantee

  \beginverse
  I had a premonition
  And I don't wanna be right
  But I saw that black cat creeping
  On my front porch last night
  Who's that on my telephone
  When I hear that line go click
  I'm gonna light a single candle, y'all
  But you know I can't resist
