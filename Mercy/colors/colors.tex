  \beginverse
  I woke up to the \[F#m]morning sky, first
  Baby blue, just \[A]like we rehearsed
  When I get up off this \[E]ground
  I shake leaves back down to the \[A]brown, brown, brown, brown
  'Til \[F#m]I'm clean
  \endverse
  \beginverse  
  Then I walk where I'd be shaded by the trees
  By a meadow of green
  For about a mile
  I'm headed to town, town, town, in style
  \endverse
  \beginchorus
  With all my favorite colors, yes, sir
  All my favorite colors, right on
  My sisters and my brothers
  See 'em like no other
  All my favorite colors

  It's a good day to be
  A good day for me
  A good day to see
  My favorite colors, colors
  My sisters and my brothers
  They see 'em like no other
  All my favorite colors
  \endchorus
  \beginverse  
  Now take me to other side
  Little bitty blues bird flies
  And gray clouds, or white walls, or blue skies
  We gon' fly, feel alright
  \endverse
  \beginverse  
  And we gon'
  \echo{Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh}, yeah
  It sound like
  \echo{Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh}, yeah
  The least I can say, I anticipate
  A homecoming parade as we renegade
  In the morning, right on
  \endverse
  \beginchorus
  With all my favorite colors, yes, sir
  All my favorite colors, yes, ma'am
  My sisters and my brothers
  See 'em like no other
  All my favorite colors
  
  All my favorite colors, right
  All my favorite colors, yes, ma'am
  My sisters and my brothers
  See 'em like no other
  All my favorite colors
