  Let me tell you now
  My heart feels heavy
  My feet feel light
  I shake all over, but
  I feel alright
  I never felt like this before
  Something's got a hold on me that won't let go

  Got me heavy without the misery
  I never thought it could be this way
  But love's sure gonna put a hurting on me

  It talk like love
  Make me feel alright
  In the middle of the night
