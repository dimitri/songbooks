  \beginverse
  \[Dm]Meet you downstairs in the \[Gm]bar and hurt
  Your \[A7]rolled-up sleeves in your \[Dm]skull t-shirt
  You say, "What \[Dm]did you do with \[Gm]him today?"
  And \[A7]sniffed me out like I was \[Dm]Tanqueray

  \[Gm]Cause you're my fella, my guy
  \[E7] Hand me your Stella and fly
  \[F]By the time I'm out the door
  You \[E7]tear me down like \[A7]Roger Moore
  \endverse
  \beginchorus
  \lilypondfile{you-know-chorus.ly}
  \[Dm] I cheated myself \[Am]
  Like I \[E7]knew I \[Am]would
  I \[Dm]told you I was \[Am]trouble
  You \[E7]know that I'm no \[Am]good
  \endchorus
  \beginverse
  ^Upstairs in bed, with ^my ex-boy
  ^He's in a place, but I ^can't get joy
  ^Thinking on you in the ^final throes
  This ^is when my ^buzzer goes

  ^Run out to meet you, chips and pitta
  You ^say, "When we're married"
  'Cause you're not bitter
  ^"There'll be none of him no more"
  I ^cried for you on the ^kitchen floor
  \endverse
  \beginchorus
  \[Dm] I cheated myself \[Am]
  Like I \[E7]knew I \[Am]would
  I \[Dm]told you I was \[Am]trouble
  You \[E7]know that I'm no \[Am]good
  \endchorus
  \beginverse
  ^Sweet reunion, Ja^maica and Spain
  We're ^like how we ^were again
  ^I'm in the tub, ^you on the seat
  ^Lick your lips as I ^soap my feet

  ^Then you notice likkle carpet burn
  My ^stomach drop and my guts churn
  You ^shrug and it's the worst
  To ^truly stuck the ^knife in first
  \endverse
  \beginchorus
  \[Dm] I cheated myself \[Am]
  Like I \[E7]knew I \[Am]would
  I \[Dm]told you I was \[Am]trouble
  You \[E7]know that I'm no \[Am]good
          
  \[Dm] I cheated myself \[Am]
  Like I \[E7]knew I \[Am]would
  I \[Dm]told you I was \[Am]trouble
  You \[E7]know that I'm no \[Am]good
