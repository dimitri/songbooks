  'Cause \[F]since I've come on home
   Well my \[Em]body's been a mess
  And I've \[F]missed your ginger hair

  \beginverse
  Did you have to go to jail
  Put your house on up for sale, did you get a good lawyer?
  I hope you didn't catch a tan
  I hope you'll find the right man who'll fix it for ya
  Are you shopping anywhere
  Changed the color of your hair, are you busy?
  And did you have to pay that fine
  That you were dodging all the time, are you still dizzy?
  \endverse
  \beginchorus
  Since I've come on home
  Well my body's been a mess
  And I've missed your ginger hair
  And the way you like to dress
  Won't you come on over?
  Stop making a fool out of me
  Why don't you come on over, Valerie?

  Since I've come on home
  Well my body's been a mess
  And I've missed your ginger hair
  And the way you like to dress

  Stop making a fool out of me
  Why don't you come on over, Valerie?
