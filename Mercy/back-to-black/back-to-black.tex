  \[Dm]He left no time to re\[Gm]gret
  Kept his dick \[Bb] wet
  With his same old \[A]safe bet
  \[Dm]Me and my head \[Gm]high
  And my tears \[Bb]dry
  Get on without \[A]my guy

  \beginverse  
  You went back to what you knew
  So far removed
  From all that we went through
  And I tread a troubled track
  My odds are stacked
  I'll go back to black
  \endverse
  
  \beginchorus
  We only said goodbye with words
  I died a hundred times
  You go back to her
  And I go back to
  I go back to us
  \endchorus
  
  \beginverse  
  I love you much
  It's not enough
  You love blow and I love puff
  And life is like a pipe
  And I'm a tiny penny
  Rolling up the walls inside
  \endverse
  
  \beginchorus
  We only said goodbye with words
  I died a hundred times
  You go back to her
  And I go back to
  We only said goodbye with words
  I died a hundred times
  You go back to her
  And I go back to
  \endchorus
