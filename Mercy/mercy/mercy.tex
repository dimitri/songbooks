  \beginverse
  \[B&7] It seems life has \[E&7]played a game on me
  \[B&7] I'm lost in a \[E&7]sea of misery
  \[B&7] My love has turned \[E&7]her back on me
  \[B&7]Heartache why won't \[E&7]you let me be
  \endverse
  \beginchorus
  Baby have some mercy please don't
  Make me beg on bended knees oh please
  Mercy, Mercy, Mercy Please have mercy on me
  Mercy, Mercy, Mercy Please
  \[Cm7]How can I face life, \[Dm7]without you
  What would I \[Gm]do \[F]if \[Gm]we \[F]were \[Gm]through?
  \endchorus
  \beginverse
  I wait for you ev'ry single night
  Hoping you'll return and make things right
  You don't show and I'm left all alone
  To pray you'll call me on the phone
  \endverse
  \beginchorus
  Baby have some mercy please don't
  Make me beg on bended knees oh please
  Mercy, Mercy, Mercy Please have mercy on me
  Mercy, Mercy, Mercy Please
  you know I love you, I'm beging
  for one more chance, once more.
  \endchorus
  \beginverse
  I know life has many a twist
  Loving you is the thing I can't resist
  Your love and understanding you've been giving
  Without it I just can't go on living
