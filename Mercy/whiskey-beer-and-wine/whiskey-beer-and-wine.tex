  Hardwood bar
  Rickety stool
  Cigarette machine
  Selling Camels and Kools
  You can solve your problems
  One drink at a time
  You can fix anything
  Over whiskey, beer, and wine
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  Dirty little bar room
  Kept the lights down low
  Icing down the long necks
  'Til they was nice and cold
  Oh you can sit down an order
  A bottle of waste your mind
  Three ways we get high
  Whiskey, beer, and wine
  \endverse
  
  \beginverse
  Corner booth in the back
  Well they have the dice
  Sit down at a table
  Shoot craps all night
  Back in the good ol' days
  Drink your troubles good bye
  Mason jar full of save your soul
  Whiskey, beer and wine
  \endverse

  In the good ol' days
  The Highland Wolf
  We called it Ignalor

  You know what I'm talking about?
  It's on my mind
  Whiskey, beer and wine

  You've got to have one with me
  I don't like doin' nothin' by myself
  Never had no fun by myself
