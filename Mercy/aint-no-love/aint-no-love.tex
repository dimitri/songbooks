  \beginverse
  But now that you're gone
  Oh, the sun don't shine
  From the city hall
  To the county line
  and that's why
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
  There ain't no love
  In the heart of the city
  Ain't no love in the heart of town
  Ain't no love, sure is a pity
  But ain't no love
  Since you're not around
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
  Every place that I go
  Oh, it feels so strange
  Without you here
  Everything has changed
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  Nighttime comes
  And there's a blanket of gloom
  Another teardrop falls
  In my lonely room
  and that's why there
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
  Ain't no love
  In the heart of the city
  Ain't no love in the heart of town
  Ain't no love, sure is a pity
  But ain't no love
  Since you're not around
  \endchorus
