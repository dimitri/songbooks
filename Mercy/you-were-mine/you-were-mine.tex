  \beginverse
  \[Gm] Take my \[B&]heart,
  \[E&] It used to be so \[D7] supple and sweet
  \[Gm] Now \[B&]it’s withered \[E&] on the \[D7]vine
              
  \[Gm] There’s \[B&] before
  \[E&] and then there’s after
  \[D7] you were mine
  \endverse
  \beginverse  
  Take my \[Gm]faith, \[B&]
  So \[E&]strong and \[D7]full of fire
  \[Gm] Now \[B&]it’s bruised,
  \[E&] broken down \[D7] and blind
                  
  \[Gm] \[B&]There’s before
  \[E&] And \[D7]then there’s after
  \[Gm] You were mine
  \[Gm] You were mine
  \endverse
  \beginchorus
  \lilypondfile[nofragment]{chorus.ly}
  \[D7]Sun comes up, sun goes down
  \[D7]World keeps rolling around and around
  \[D7]The hands on the clock Going tick tock tick tock
  Ain’t the \[D]way I \[C]measure \[B&]time\[A]
  \[Gm]There’s just \[B&] before
  And \[E&] then there’s \[D7] after
  \[Gm] You were mine
  \[Gm] You were mine
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
  Take my hands,
  They used to hold you so tight
  Now they reach,
  But never touch you in the night

  There’s before
  And then there’s after
  \[Gm] You were mine
  \[Gm] You were mine
  \endverse
  \beginchorus
  \[D7]Sun comes up, sun goes down
  \[D7]World keeps rolling around and around
  \[D7]The hands on the clock Going tick tock tick tock
  Ain’t the \[D]way I \[C]measure \[B&]time\[A]

  There’s before
  And then there’s after
  There’s before
  And then there’s after
  There’s before, There's before
  And then there’s after
          
  You were mine
