  \beginverse
  When some\[Dm]body \[Gm7]reaches for your \[Fm7]heart
  \[Gm7]Open up and \[Fm7]let them \[A7]through
  'Cause every\[Dm7]body \[Gm7]needs someone \[Fm7]around
  \[Gm7]Things can \[Fm7]tumble down on \[C]you
  You'll discover when you look around
  You don't have to be alone
  Just one lover is all you need to know
  When you're feeling all alone
