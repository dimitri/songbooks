  \beginverse
  I'm gonna \[C]put on my dress
  \[C]With those pits above the side
  With that, tight thin waist
  And that low neck line
  Lord I'm \[F]going to the party
  Gonna have some fun
  Gonna \[C] shake and shout
  Until the morning calls
  If you \[G7]wanna keep your man
  You better \[F]keep as sharp as you can
  I'll be \[C]at my best
  When I put on my soulful dress \[G]

  I'm gonna put on my dress
  That hits me way above my knees
  With that v-cut back
  It has straps instead of sleeves
  Lord I'm going to the party
  Uuuh, looking good
  I'm gonna shake everybody
  Like I knew I would
  Don't you girls go and gettin jealous
  If I round up all your fellows
  Cause I'll be at my best
  When I wear my soulful dress
  \endverse
