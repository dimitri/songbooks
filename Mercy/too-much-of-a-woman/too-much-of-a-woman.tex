  \beginverse
  Too loud, too strong, too much attitude
  I better learn how to play along
  Before your ego ends  up bruised
  I'm sorry to tell you brother
  I'm not living for your comfort
  You can go cryin' to your mother
  Cause I'm gon' do what I'm gon' do
  \endverse
  
  \beginchorus
  \lilypondfile[nofragment]{chorus.ly}  
  If I'm too much of a woman
  You can kindly step aside
  A true king can handle me
  He's got what it  takes inside
  Well, I hate to disappoint ya
  By now you should  understand
  If I'm too much of a woman,  boy
  You're too little of a man
  If I'm too much of a woman
  If I'm too much of a woman
  \endchorus
  
  \beginverse
  \lilypondfile[nofragment]{verse-2.ly}  
  Too big, too small,
  We can never measure up
  The lips, the eyes, the hips, the thighs
  I'm tired of all your nipping and tuck
  You keep me in a cage but you don't like to hear me roar
  Well, it's time to break the silence
  I can't take it no more
  \endverse
  
  \textnote{Chorus}
  
  \beginverse
  \textnote{Bridge}
  \lilypondfile[nofragment]{bridge.ly}
  Trying to appease you
  Had me out my mind
  I won't let it happen this time
  \endverse
  
  \textnote{Solo}
  
  \beginchorus
  \lilypondfile[nofragment]{outro.ly}
  If I'm too much of a woman
  You can kindly step aside
  A true king can handle me
  He's got what it  takes inside
  Well, I hate to disappoint ya
  By now you should  understand
  If I'm too much of a woman 
  If I'm too much of a woman 
  If I'm too much of a woman,  boy
  You're too little of a man
  \endchorus
