\beginsong{Grandma's Hands}[by={Bill Withers}]

  \beginverse
  \[Em]Grandma's hands
  Clapped in church on Sunday morning
  Grandma's hands
  Played a \[B]tambourine so well
  \[Em]Grandma's hands
  Used to issue out a warning
  \[Em]She'd say,
  \[B]Billy don't you \[A]run so fast
  \[B]Might fall on a \[B]piece of glass
  \[B]Might be snakes there in that \[A]grass
  \[Em]Grandma's hands
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  Grandma's hands
  Soothed a local unwed mother
  Grandma's hands
  Used to ache sometimes and swell
  Grandma's hands
  Used to lift her face and tell her
  She'd say, Baby, grandma understands
  That you really love that man
  Put yourself in Jesus' hands
  Grandma's hands
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  Grandma's hands
  Used to hand me piece of candy
  Grandma's hands
  Picked me up each time I fell
  Grandma's hands
  Boy, they really came in handy
  She'd say, Matty don' you whip that boy
  What you want to spank him for?
  He didn' drop no apple core
  But I don't have grandma anymore
  If I get to heaven I'll look for
  Grandma's hands
  Hmm-mmh
  \endverse
