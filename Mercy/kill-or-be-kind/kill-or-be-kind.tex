  \beginverse
  Back before I was a homewrecker
  I was a goodie good, good girl
  Back before I was your heartbreaker
  I was someone you could adore
  \endverse
  
  \beginverse    
  Back before the love we made made me out a fool
  I was looking for something more
  Back before I put the fear of God in you
  I was afraid to walk through your  door
  \endverse

  Make up your mind,
  I can kill or be kind 
  Ooh ooh Ooh ooh   
  Baby, you decide, 
  I can kill or be kind

  \beginverse  
  Back before my kiss branded you
  You were wild and free to roam
  Back before I made a mess of the man in you
  You were happy to be alone
