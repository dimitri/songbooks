  \[Bm] At \[A] love I al\[Em]ways lose \[F#7]
  \[Bm] I \[A]keep looking for \[Em]one good man \[F#7]
  \[Bm] \[A] And I ain't \[Em]got no clue \[F#7]
  I can't \[Em]find no one \[Em]to love me \[F#7] \[F#7]
  I guess I'm married to the \[Bm]blues \[A] \[Em] \[F#7]
  Married to the \[Bm]blues \[A] \[Em] \[F#7]

  \beginverse
  There's a picture by my bedside
  In a frame that's got a crack
  Of one of my old lovers
  Who ain't never comin' back
  He swore he'd never leave me
  Then I saw him start to pack
  Start to pack

  \beginchorus
  Oh when you're \[Em]married to the \[Em]blues
  You don't \[Bm]get no band of \[Bm]gold
  All you \[F#7]get is a lonely \[F#7]cab ride
  To a \[Bm]bed that's always \[Bm]cold
  When you're \[Em]married to the \[Em]blues
  Forget \[Bm]that honeymoon \[Bm]
  All you \[G]get is luke-warm \[G]lovin'
  That's \[F#7]over way, way too soon

  \beginverse
  There's a letter in my pocket           
  It's all torn torn  torn and frayed
  It's the only thing only thing he left me
  Before my man before he ran away
  Now when you're married to the blues        
  It gets more lonely everyday
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  Oh... All these blues

  I knew he would leave me
  He was never comin' back
  He left me a torn letter
  Then he ran away
  Ran away
  Married to the blues
  Oh... All these blues

  You get so lonely
  Lonely
  Lonely
  Lonely
  Married to the blues
