  \beginverse
   \[E]I live in a little house on the side of the street
  Where the grass is dead but they water the con\[B]crete
  \[E]In the summer I watch the people float by
  In the \[A]winter I watch them weep and cry, I
  \[E] Live in a little house \[B]on the side of the \[E]street
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  \[E]I live in a little house on the side of the road
  Where the people starve just to feed their cars and \[B]boats
  In the \[E]fall, the men they stomp and shout
  In the \[A]spring, the women frolic about, I
  \[E] Live in a little \[B]house on the side of the \[E]road, yeah

  \beginverse
  I live in a place where the people wonder why
  Why the grass is always greener on the other side
  In the day they go to work and wait
  In the night, they drink their fears away, I
  Live in a place where the people wonder why
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
  Oh, try to believe
  That work will set you free
  Only wise men see that we were
  Always
  We're always free
  \endchorus

  Oh, try to believe
  That work will set you free
  Oh, try to believe
  That work will set you free
  Only wise men see that we were
  Always

  \beginchorus
  Always free, yeah
  We were always free
  What the hell, nice
  But I'll drink another drink, and then we'll do it again
