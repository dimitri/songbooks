  \beginverse
  \[Am7]Stayed in bed all morning
  Just to \[D6]pass the time
  \[Am7]There's something wrong here,
  There can be \[D6]no denying
  \[Am7]One of us is changing,
  or \[Gm7]maybe we've just stopped \[FM7]trying
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
  \lilypondfile[nofragment]{chorus1.ly}
  
  And it's \[BbM7]too late, baby, now \[FM7]it's too late
  Though we \[BbM7]really did try to \[FM7]make it
  \[BbM7]Something inside has \[FM7]died and I can't \[Dm7]hide
  And I just can't \[Esus4]fake \[Em7]it,
  Oh \[Am7]no no \[D6] \[Am7] \[D6]
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
  It used to be so easy living here with you
  You were light and breezy
  and I knew just what to do
  Now you look so unhappy,
  and I feel like a fool
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
  \lilypondfile[nofragment]{chorus2.ly}

  And it's too late, baby, now it's too late
  Though we really did try to make it
  Something inside has died and I can't hide
  And I just can't fake it, oh no no
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
  There'll be good times again for me and you
  But we just can't stay together,
  Don't you feel it too
  Still I'm glad for what we had,
  And how I once loved you
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
  \lilypondfile[nofragment]{chorus2.ly}
  
  But it's too late, baby, now it's too late
  Though we really did try to make it
  Something inside has died and I can't hide
  And I just can't fake it, Oh no no no no no
