\beginsong{Falling in Love Again}[by={Dojo Cuts}]
  \beginverse
  When I \[Am] hold on, will you catch my \[Bm]fall?
  These \[Am]walls keep buildin' higher, oh heaven \[Bm]knows
  On the \[Am]rooftop hear the wind \[Bm]blows
  An escape \[Am] from these walls is calling to let \[Bm]go
  \endverse
  \beginchorus
  \[Bm] \[Am] Fallin' in love again,
  \[Bm] \[Am] I keep fallin' in love again
  \[Bm] \[Am] Fallin' in love again,
  \[Bm] \[Am] I keep fallin' in love again
  \endchorus
  \textnote{Solo}
  \beginverse
  Take me \[Am]for a ride down the \[Bm]old road
  Let's \[Am]see which path will take the heavy \[Bm] load
  Oh, the \[Am]street light, I can see \[Bm]hope
  There's \[Am]too much to hold to just to let \[Bm]go
  \endverse
  \beginchorus
  \[Bm] \[Am] Fallin' in love again,
  \[Bm] \[Am] I keep fallin' in love again
  \[Bm] \[Am] Fallin' in love again,
  \[Bm] \[Am] I keep fallin' in love again
  \endchorus
  \beginverse
  When I hold you close, [?] for a ride
  I been holdin' on, I been holdin' back
  What's the use in that? What's the fuse to do that?
  When I hold up my fire, they back in fire
  \endverse
  \beginverse
  Oh, how you used to this? But Im'a get used to it
  Hear my calling out, now I'm not holding out
  I'm fallin' fast, no it's no disaster
  We gon' start again, work it out 'till we're whole again 'cause
  \endverse
  \beginchorus
  \[Bm] \[Am] Fallin' in love again,

  \[Bm] \[Am] Fallin' in love again,
  \[Bm] \[Am] I keep fallin' in love again
