  \beginverse
  \[A] It's okay in the day,
  I'm \[A&]staying busy
  \[C#m] Tied up enough so I don't have to wonder
  \[C]Where is he
  Got \[EM7]so sick of crying,
  So \[C#m] just lately
  When \[C]I catch myself, I do a \[F#m]180 \[F]
  \endverse
  \beginverse              
  ^ I stay up, clean the house,
  At least ^I'm not drinking
  ^Run around just so I don't have
  To think ^about thinking
  That ^silent sense of content
  That ^ everyone gets
  Just ^disappears soon as ^the sun sets ^
  \endverse
  \beginchorus

  \[D] He's fierce in my dreams, seizes my guts
  He \[G]floods me with \[E9] dread
  \[D] Soaked in soul,
  He swims in my \[G] eyes by the \[E9] bed
  \[D] Pour myself  over him, \[G]moon spilling \[E9] in
  \[C] And I wake \[Bm]up a\[D#M7]lone
  \endchorus
  \beginverse  
  If I was my heart
  I'd rather be restless
  The second I stop the sleep catches up
  and I'm breathless
  As this ache in my chest,
  As my day is done now
  The dark covers me and I cannot run now
  \endverse
  \beginverse  
  My blood running cold, I stand before him
  It's all I can do to assure him
  When he comes to me, I drip for him tonight
  Drowned in me, we bathe under blue light
  \endverse
  \beginchorus
  His face in my dreams seizes my guts
  He floods me with dread
  Soaked in soul, he swims in my eyes by the bed
  Pour myself over him, moon spilling in
  And I wake up alone \rep{4}
  \endchorus
