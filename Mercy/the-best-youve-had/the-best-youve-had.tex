  \beginverse
  You call me \[Cm]devious
  But you don't under\[Fm]stand that all I \[G]am
  Is a little mys\[Cm]terious
  I have no other \[Fm]cause
  Ready in my \[G]hand
  So why the hys\[Cm]teria?
  I've tried to stand my \[Fm]ground
  But my hands are \[G]bound
  From your tougher ex\[Cm]terior
  You're waiting for the \[Fm]right time
  To shoot me down \[G]

  And when I'm \[Cm]falling you break my \[Fm]heart
  But I will \[G]end up inside your \[G]arms

  I will lose the fight
