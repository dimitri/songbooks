  \beginverse
  I can feel the basslines
  Pumping to the heart of me
  And that golden voice so sweet
  Makes me wanna dance, makes me wanna sing
  Feverish with anticipation
  Waiting at your beck and call
  Here comes that old soul
  Waiting to tell us all
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
  \lilypondfile[nofragment]{chorus.ly}
  With a voice so clear you talk to me
  Like a whisper in a hurricane
  I knew that you would be a poet of our age
  Come talk to me real easy with that whisper
  A whisper in a hurricane
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
  Man, you have so much to say
  With so much wisdom
  Running through your veins
  You tell it how it is
  Not how it should be
  You always cut right through
  To the very hеart of me
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
  With a voice so clear you talk to mе
  Like a whisper in a hurricane
  I knew that you would be a poet of our age
  Come talk to me real easy with that whisper
  A whisper in a hurricane
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
  The calm that follows the storm
  Oh, you weathered through it all
  When you persevered
  When all the mothers feared in you
  Oh, you stood so tall
  A man that time won't forget
  You didn't care what the other man said
  Kept your dignity and pride
  Oh, and held us captive with your truthful mind
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
  With a voice so clear you talk to me
  Like a whisper in a hurricane
  I knew that you would be a poet of our age
  Come talk to me real easy
  With that whisper in a hurricane
  Like a whisper
  \endchorus
