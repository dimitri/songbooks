  Birds flying high
  You know how I feel
  Sun in the sky
  You know how I feel
  Breeze driftin' on by
  You know how I feel
  It's a new dawn
  It's a new day
  It's a new life
  For me
  And I'm feeling good
  I'm feeling good

  \beginverse
  Dragonfly out in the sun,
  You know what I mean,
  Don't you know
  Butterflies all havin' fun,
  You know what I mean
  Sleep in peace when day is done,
  That's what I mean
  And this old world is a new world
  And a bold world
  For me
  For me

  \beginverse
  Stars when you shine
  You know how I feel
  Scent of the pine
  You know how I feel
  Oh, freedom is mine
  And I know how I feel
  It's a new dawn
  It's a new day
  It's a new life
  For me
  And I'm feeling good
  \endverse

  It's a new life
  For me
  And I'm feeling good
  I'm feeling good
  I feel so good
  I feel so good
