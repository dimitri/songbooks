  \beginverse
  Who knows what tomorrow will bring
  Maybe sunshine, and maybe rain
  But as for me I'll wait and see
  And maybe it'll bring my love to me
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  Who knows
  Who knows
  Who knows it better than I
  That it's she who's keeping me alive
  Keeping the little girl as my goal
  Makes my life worth living alone
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  Another day
  Another day
  Just another day
  I wanna live
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  To share the love that only she can give
  And if she don't come on home
  I pray the Lord will help me carry on
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  Another day
  Another day
  Just another day (oh Lord)
  Another day
  Another day
  Just another day
  I wanna live
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  To share the love that only she can give
  And if she don't come on home
  I pray the Lord will help me carry on
  Another day
  Another day
  Just another day (oh Lord)
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  For who knows what tomorrow will bring
  Maybe sunshine, and maybe rain
  But as for me I'll wait and see
  \endverse
