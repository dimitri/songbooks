  \beginverse
  So hail a taxi cab and come around here
  And I will meet you right outside.
  I got some DVD's and a couple of beers,
  If you want to,
  We can stay up all night.
  \endverse
  
  \beginverse
  It's nothing fancy, just a little couch and me
  And conversation for your mind.
  So let's explore all the possibilities
  Of the things that we both talked about last time.
  \endverse
  
  \beginchorus
  \lilypondfile[nofragment]{chorus.ly}
  Take a trip to my yard
  Don't you know the grass is greener on the other side?
  Take a trip to my yard
  Don't you know the love that you've been dreaming of is mine?
  \endchorus
  
  \beginverse
  I'll be your neighbor at the other end of town
  And the benefits you soon will find.
  So let's enjoy the fact that we're on our own
  And we will answer to nobody else this time.
  \endverse
  
  \beginverse
  Tonight might be nothing but the moon and me
  Any time that we take the script and flip it baby
  Take a trip to my yard
  \endverse
  
  \beginchorus
  Take a trip to my yard
  Don't you know the grass is greener on the other side?
  Take a trip to my yard
  Don't you know the love that you've been dreaming of is mine?
  \endchorus
