  \beginverse
  I've been telling baby
  I ain't got no place to go
  I've been telling mama
  I ain't got no place to go
  I've been everywhere lil' darlin'
  But I don't wanna go no more
  \endverse

  \beginverse  
  I left home when I was a kid
  Everything I did was wrong
  I left home when I was a kid
  Everything I did was wrong
  Now I would like to settle down darlin'
  But I ain't got no happy home
  \endverse

  \beginverse  
  I've been telling baby
  I got no place to stay
  I've been telling mama
  I ain't got no place to stay
  I've got travelin' on my mind
  Yet I be on my way
  \endverse
  \beginverse  
  So sorry, so sorry
  But now I got to go
  So sorry, so sorry sweetheart
  But now I've got to go
  But it's time tomorrow baby
  I will be a long way down the road  
  \endverse
