  \beginverse
  Who wrote all those disgraceful laws? 
  Who told us it’s the only way to go?
  Who agreed upon this greedy peace? 
  Who decided to destroy the walls?
  Who told her drinking is a ruin?
  Stranded off the dirty roads, the miracle is above my head 
  and all the prayers in the world won’t ever bring it back to life 
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  How far do we intend to drive it away?
  How long will we search for some fake control?
  Stranded off the dirty roads, the miracle is above my head 
  Who tampered with the flesh? Who could think that he has won?
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  But there is no point in looking back
  and There is no point in feeling sad
  It supersedes all of our highest plans
  I start losing sight of the side of the road
  Is it all over now? 
  \endverse
