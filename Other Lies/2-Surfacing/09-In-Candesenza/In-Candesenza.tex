  The \[Em]secret touch \[F#m]played on her,
  I whispered the nice words she liked to hear
  But in the rays of the flat suns nothing came
  Forever yours does not always seem,
  What it seems to me
  They said freedom is in our hands

  \beginchorus
  And the fire sings
  In Candesenza
  Her brittle voice fades like in a twilight
  And with some cold blood,
  I could break the walls
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
  I heard about the famous great relief of the comfort drugs
  And the freedom brought by the rod of steel/engraved by his holy scheme
  Are they singing or caring or loving now?
  While we are just wait in rows
  We are all just those loners now
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
  Have we done too much or far from enough?
  The heavy black coat of anguish slips off my shoulders
  And I start sinking into the depths
  Of Bourbon and oblivion
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
  Will we ever reach the surface?
  Heavy hopes take us deeper and deeper
  So I don't really want to grow up,
  Will we ever see a bloody miracle?
  Time is up and nothing came,
  So I really do not want to know
  \endverse
