  \beginverse
  Hearing laughers in the dark 
  Seeing unusual moves in the corner of the room
  Instead of wider skies
  This haunting call in my head 
  Still fuels my days away
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  My desire for empty spaces is real or is just gasoline
  My desire is a drunken blackout through and through and through 
  My desire takes me away from you
  \endverse

  \beginverse  
  But staring in the eyes of the highway girls and at the distant stars at night
  This awkward feeling slowly deteriorating
  And the fear of the places around starts to take hold
  \endverse

  \beginverse  
  And if this desire for loneliness disappears or rolls back
  And if someday I find my way home
  Will this still wring my heart? 
  Will you be there, too?  
  \endverse
