  \beginverse
  Uh I am a slave of my body well,
  I am a slave for you
  I bury my fears, around the world
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
  And I am speeding And I am alive
  And I am speeding And I am alive
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
  Soothed, frozen, tired and sore
  In the morning haze
  Devastated, bleached away,
  United in the flesh  
  And Iâ€™ll do it again,
  I know it for sure
  \endverse
  
  \beginchorus
  And I am speeding And I am alive
  And I am speeding And I am alive
  And I am speeding And I am alive
  \endchorus
  
  \beginverse
  Luckily my eyes told (me)
  Where my treasure was
  In this flesh and in my heart
  My soul called in vain
  as I was drenched in sweat
  I was starving and my body drove
  \endverse
