  \beginverse
  You know my love for the smiles obscene and feather earrings and things
  But I am so restrained when my own dream comes true
  At every corner my heart changes I am so in need of self-esteem but I feel like
  I have been hit so hard and left dying 
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  No face of war, no fear, no picture of violence comes to me 
  Just this very pure frustration calling over and over in
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  Soaking in her hair a hundred times, reckless, relentless of the sin
  l mutilate myself just to smell her neck
  just scattering myself to the four winds
  Still the smell of her skin is calling in
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  Did you read it on my lips or did I say it at loud?
  Your pout tells me you now how far I intended to go
  the morning smears up the faces of the easy girls
  but I hope that behind this smooth and lifeless face,
  someone hears and understands
  \endverse
