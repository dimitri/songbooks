\beginsong{Dead End For Delhia}[by={Other Lies}]

  \beginverse
  Her mysterious smile is distorted now 
  In the cigarette smoke, in the petrol fumes
  and in that orient spell and murmurs as she relieves her soul
  Her life then goes and the fascination ends 
  \endverse

  \beginverse  
  Was there any reality in her dreams? 
  Was she trying to withhold it like me? 
  She’s got nothing left to say 
  Left for dead on that distant shore\rep{2}
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  I am galvanized as I stare at her
  Trapped or diluted in this burning wood
  This is her great escape from our vulgar life
  Her perfume made me forget how to do things right
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  Now beasts of battle sings their lullaby
  While I can’t even remember her voice
  Her powers still intact
  Left for dead on a distant shore
  \endverse

  \beginverse  
  What does she feel inside now?\rep{2}
  It’s a different kind/way of being lost
  \endverse
