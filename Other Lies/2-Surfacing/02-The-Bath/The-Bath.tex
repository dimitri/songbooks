\beginsong{The Bath}[by={Other Lies}]

  \beginverse
  On the clear waters where the stars sleep,
  I flap in the wind of winter lands !
  Where the clouds stain the sky, she is here again 
  Calling inside my head,
  her eyes are blinking, she is here every day
  It’s louder every day
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
  Despised and insane,
  she is spread away everywhere
  Despised and insane,
  getting stronger anyway
  \endchorus

  \beginverse  
  While the breath of wind twists her great hair,
  I wait for her to whisper 
  Her visions of faith and illusions of youth 
  Less distant than dreams,
  she moves along but the damage is done
  She flickers on the tide
  \endverse

  \beginchorus  
  She lies here pale and frail,
  so beautiful as snow
  She won’t wave me goodbye,
  like almost every time
  \endchorus

  \beginverse  
  No tear no cry no bitter love 
  As she rests with her head in the flood 
  All disappears in the high waves
  and a misty blue light falls strangely from the stars
  From the stars
  \endverse
