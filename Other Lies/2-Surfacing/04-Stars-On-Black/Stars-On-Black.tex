  \beginverse
  Our pilgrimage comes to its end in this scent of Arabia
  A faithless and hopeless journey that feels more like the end of time
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
  Now I left my hope to trap you in my heart again
  Nothing will ever shine onto my darkness again
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
  I saw our celestial dreams dying 
  And the mirages of the ordinary life 
  Now all gods are destroyed, you left me stranded in here
  So discouraged with the futures unknown
  Whenever this machine will break down and leave me alone
  \endverse

  \beginchorus  
  Now I left my hope to trap you in my heart again
  And nothing will ever shine onto my darkness
  I do not feel any better dressed up in rags like this
  In that very place where I lost my faith 
  \endchorus

  \beginverse  
  Born in the sad cemetery of the great empires
  Grown up in the shadow of some dead dreams
  Why have I fooled myself like this?
  What do I have traded my joy for?
  \endverse
