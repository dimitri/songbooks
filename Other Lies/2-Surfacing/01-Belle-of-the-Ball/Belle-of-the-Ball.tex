  \beginverse
  My left eye can’t lie
  You plucked me out of my idle years
  and this does not leave my mind
  \endverse

  \beginverse

  I am incapable of keeping my distance 
  \endverse

  \beginverse

  No one knows our intentions
  With such whimpers will you implode?
  Douse me with gasoline and I‘ll lose control
  \endverse

  \beginverse

  I am incapable of keeping my distance 
  Show me a piece of skin and I’ll overdose
  \endverse

  \beginverse

  Are you facing your demons, too? 
  The things you keep untold
  In the colorful lights you are clearly exposed
  \endverse
