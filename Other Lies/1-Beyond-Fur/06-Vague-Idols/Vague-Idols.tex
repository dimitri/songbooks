  \beginverse
  One day I will lose all I have
  King of scums and flawed alive
  Would I just be so brave like you?
  I wish I could be so careless like you
  I wish to mouth the words that could have saved you  
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  Sometimes I am just so helpless so distressed
  Sometimes I feel like your spirit has been blown 
  In the torn trees
  and I am just haunted by miserable things that’s leave me sad an cold
  Feels like all this been told before
  Feels like I’ve been enslaved for years 
  \endverse
  
  \beginchorus
  And all these illusions still have such a power on me 
  and I am still waiting that the sin
  In this township of grief/greed
  Whips me up with its leather strips
  \endchorus
  
  \beginverse
  Ruined by the words that were supposed to save and relieve
  Ravaged under the malicious smiles
  Of some idols
  Feel like I have been engraved for years in the ashes of life
  Feels like all this been told before 
  Feels like I’ve been enslaved for years 
  \endverse
