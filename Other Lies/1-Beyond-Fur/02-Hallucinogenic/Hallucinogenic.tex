  \beginverse
  All drenched in blood still ashamed of my sweetest plans
  It hurts like hell 
  Lost under the map of the stars

  It feels like every drop of your color strikes me dead 
  Like every drop of it talks about you again
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  If only it could smile to me once again
  I would not try to scratch my skin away
  Iâ€™d watch you twisting in the light
  This rainbow is like 
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
  A big stain of light
  Like every part of you has been spread all over the landscape
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
  I sometimes wonder about this silence
  Leaving us lost in this big anywhere
  And I wonder are you really this glowing flower above my head?
  Leaving me squashed and squirming on the floor
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  It looks like you just tuned/sent me out
  Some millions light years away
  Everybody knew it before
  \endverse
