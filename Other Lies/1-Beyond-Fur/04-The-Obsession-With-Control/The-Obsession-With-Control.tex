\beginsong{The Obsession with Control}[by={Other Lies}]

  \beginverse
  My dare devil makes me walk the high wire
  And fuels my obsession with control
  You bet I'd fight to save my body
  And I won’t think twice
  I thought our energy could prevail
  Dreaming of some faraway banks
  I knew it’d be forever gone when you’d be done
  \endverse
  
  \beginchorus
  Space deforms and reforms and deforms itself every time
  We will reach the impossible
  Going back where we belong
  \endchorus
  
  \beginverse
  We reaches each other’s ugliest side
  No language at all but the dirt lies 
  At the bottom of our heart
  With flavored airwaves, blue flames burns the visitor's hand
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
  But in alcoholic dreams we will reconcile our extreme ends
  We will rebuilt the unknown and turn off this obsession with control
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
  I know I am not out of reach, give it a real shot now!
  You know I am not out of reach
  Where the hell are you now?
  \endverse
