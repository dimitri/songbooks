\beginsong{The Incense of Valletta}[by={Other Lies}]

  \chordsoff
  \beginverse
  How did we lose sight of Valletta?
  Some say at dawn, some say in the twilight
  Or because of our lack of faith
  Not holding the light in vain
  But I know it was the blindness of our excess
  All draped in some flags of convenience
  And within the empty hours of silence
  Tell me where did I go wrong?
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
  And we all stare at our prayers rising in the black sky of Monrovia
  They murmur about our failures
  Left up in the air
  
  Tears carefully left unanswered as we are slowly breaking apart  
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
  Smoke falls back on our heads and they are creeping us out with the silly shadow of death 
  And the devil of good hopes but we will keep on till they stop us
  \endverse
