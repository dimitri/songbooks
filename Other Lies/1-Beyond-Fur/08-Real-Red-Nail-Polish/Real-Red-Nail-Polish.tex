  \beginverse
  Hide it just as the devil would,
  like the treasure of the Incas
  Like the last sacred thing we've left on earth
  All those useless things I can afford,
  Won’t bring me this pleasure
  That sends me spinning on and on
  \endverse
  
  \beginchorus
  Would you please make it for real this time,
  Please tell me what I want to hear 
  Because I dream myself,
  and I don't want to be stolen in vain
  
  We both know the clever deal, united, divided
  And when the sun rise I go cursing on the famous streets 
  \endchorus
  
  \beginverse
  Revenge howls everywhere,
  It’s bashing my head away
  The shiny, the priceless thing, 
  Sweetheart you hide it pretty dawned well 
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  Behind the make-up, behind fur 
  Behind the speeches and behind lies
  Behind poses, behind smiles
  Are you always that meaningless?
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  When the sun rises
  It seems I understand it all
  And the deadly spell ends
  Please confess before you go
  \endverse
