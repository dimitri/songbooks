  \beginverse
  Perfumed by the waves,
  My flower's vandalized by stranger's hands
  She's my travelling friend
  Though she sometimes looks unsafe
  I gave her everything
  And I just get burned in return
  \endverse
  
  \beginchorus
  \lilypondfile[nofragment]{chorus.ly}
  For hours and hours I am diluting myself in her
  For hours and hours I am fooled by some devilish violence
  For hours and hours I cannot feel more alive
  \endchorus
  
  \beginverse
  You saw her soul dancing
  At the gator's retreat
  Pulverizing our vulgar lives
  With her own color scheme
  She is a leather dream, obscene pristine
  But she is the promise that will never come true
  \endverse
  
  \beginchorus
  My gasoline smell, my energy smile
  I am so uptight she is so alive
  And for hours and hours, her color won't fade avay after
  Hours and hours
  Nothing good must remain
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
  Perfumed by the waves,
  My flower's vandalized by stranger's hands
  She's my travelling friend
  But she sometimes loose her nerves
  \endverse
  
  \beginchorus
  And I end up with nothing
  But some of her perfume on my skin
  And I end up with nothing
  But some of her perfume on my skin
  \endchorus
