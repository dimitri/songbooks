  \beginverse
  You, you could not stop dreaming
  Pain is comforting, the promise says and The night forgives 
  You could not get what you asked for,
  Now you can really feel it, Now you know
  The common people’ misery that’s kicking in
  \endverse
  
  \beginchorus
  Now It sometimes wakes you up in your sleep,
  You can’t hinder nor erase it 
  This hits inside but still you want to fake it,
  As you don’t want to die left trying

  Now, you’re fighting to solve it,
  it’s all about walls and keys
  as much as you want to get it you’re losing it 
  \endchorus
  
  \beginverse
  Now It always makes you weep,
  You just can’t deny nor forget about it 
  It cuts so deep but still you just ignore it
  as you don’t want to die left hoping 
  \endverse
  \textnote{Solo}
  
  \beginverse
  Why the world is indifferent?
  Why would anyone feel sorry?
  When you start to fall there is no way back
  Thinking of saving your soul will cure it or make it worse?
  Was it the promise of a monster or a ghost?
  \endverse
  
  \beginchorus
  You were such a believer,
  Now you are left in the middle of nowhere
  I saw you starting talking to yourself now,
  I dare you to confess you are not praying now
  The walls, The walls are so close
  \endchorus
