  \beginverse
  Aren’t we just still the same?
  Why could we not just feel it again? 
  Wandering naively through the night,
  Has our dust already poured right down?
  We were not the guilty ones,
  We were not thinking twice 
  We were just bright and straight lines,
  It was an hour, a day, a year in our lives
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
  Time has taken its deadly bite
  But this pulsing beat was real
  These were our glory days
  When we were the teens for today
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
  Have we started dissolving,
  Into the mighty empty blue space?
  We thought our faces would never change
  But our names are already written down here 
  Time might have dissolved our dreams
  And it might have sandblasted our hopes 
  It can’t destroy our memories,
  The best things in life are always free
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
  Time has taken its deadly bite
  But this pulsing beat was real 
  These were our glory days
  When we were the teens for today
  \endchorus

  \beginchorus
  Time has taken its deadly bite
  But this pulsing beat was real 
  These were our glory days
  When we were the teens for today
