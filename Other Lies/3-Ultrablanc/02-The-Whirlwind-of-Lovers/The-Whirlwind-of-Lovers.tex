  Itâ€™s pouring down like a magic gas,
  Over the sodium lights, over the grass
  There were cold flames,
  There were dimmed lights
  And then a flash light in my eyes
  It was shining like a million stars,
  We were lifted up in the sky
  So my superstition is for you
  Like fluffing up in the air!
  \endverse

  This is the whirlwind of lovers!
