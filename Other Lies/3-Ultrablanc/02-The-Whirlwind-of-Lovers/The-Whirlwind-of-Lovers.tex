  \beginverse
  It’s pouring down like a magic gas,
  Over the sodium lights, over the grass
  There were cold flames, there were dimmed glares
  And then a flash light in my eyes
  It was shining like a million stars,
  We were lifted up in the sky
  So my superstition is for you
  Like fluffing up in the air!
  \endverse

  This is the whirlwind of lovers!

  And as the oval rises above the triangle,
  Victory is heard by some (weiner)
