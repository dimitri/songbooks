\beginsong{The Whirlwind of Lovers}[by={Other Lies}]

  \beginverse
  Itâ€™s pouring down like a magic gas,
  Over the sodium lights, over the grass
  There were cold flames, there were dimmed glares
  And then a flash light in my eyes
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  It was shining like a million stars,
  We were lifted up in the sky
  So my superstition is for you
  Like fluffing up in the air!
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
  This is the whirlwind of lovers!
  \endchorus

  \textnote{Solo}

  \beginchorus
  And as the oval rises above the triangle,
  Victory is heard by some (weiner)
  \endchorus
