\beginsong{The Color of Thunder}[by={Other Lies}]

  \beginverse
  In the clarity of dreams,
  With more beauty than in magazines 
  I feel my heart is no more prisoner
  And it shines, shines \& shines in me
  That dazzling thing is calling
  Calling calling calling me in  
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
  I am floating in a sort of milky way 
  Under the blue light of wonder
  Ends my intimate war 
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
  Things of the world seem futile now,
  Its hardcore noises, its painful sicknesses
  Feels like I am done fighting my rainy days,
  Driven to this plain afterlife
  Under this blinking austral sky,
  It feels like I have cracked 
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
  The mystery of life wide open 
  At Eternity’s gate, it’s the final swing
  Finish me off or wrap this warm light
  Around my heart 
  \endchorus

  \textnote{Solo}

  \beginverse
  Its calling in vain…
  Into this white sky, clashes my intimate war 
  \endverse
