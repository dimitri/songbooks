  \beginverse
  I believe the drugs start to take hold,
  I see nothing at all
  I drift near the surface and sails
  In the distance are just making noise
  And start waving me home
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
  And suffused in light and drowned
  In sultry dreams that scream my weakness
  And suffused in light and drowned
  In sultry dreams that scream “without you”
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
  I believe the drugs start to take hold,
  I see nothing at all
  I drift near the surface and sails,
  I really start leaving the shore
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
  And suffused in light and drowned
  In sultry dreams that scream my weaknesses
  And suffused in light and drowned
  In sultry dreams that scream “without you”
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
  I violated all the rules that apply to anyone but you? \rep{2}
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  They have murdered the dream
  They have run over it
  They have faded it to grey
  And I fell in disgrace 
  They have silenced the wind
  and I fading to say… 
  They brought me down to nothing 
  Under this bowed sky,
  I am such a lonely drifter, drifter, now
  \endverse
