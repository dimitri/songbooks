  \beginverse
  After love is found I wonder, what’s on my mind?
  I fight and lose every day, shivering, pale and disarmed

  \endverse

  
  \beginchorus
  I don’t mind, I don’t mind at all
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
  As the old times are now forgotten, I do want to smile
  Looking into some young eyes was fuelling the lure
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
  Now I don’t mind, I don’t mind at all
  \endchorus
  
  \beginverse
  Riding on fake lands with my old friends
  I can’t wash my sins away by myself
  Forget about the outdated deal 
  Watch me chained to lonely pleasures and pains 
  I forgot you casually by now 
  I am crawling on all fours/Now the Bull is in the Haze
  Crossing the way (barrer la route)
  \endverse
