  \beginverse
  Remove your mask! why?
  So I can remember your face! why?
  Cos’ something is happening
  and I am scared to know its name
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  In my mouth your name dissolved, why?
  Whispered in my fitful sleeps, why?
  Its like detuning the radio until I hear it clear 
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
  \lilypondfile[nofragment]{chorus.ly}
  
  Paramount is that thing I have lost
  Paramount is the mystery of yours
  Paramount is that poison swirl in my brain
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
  I don’t like your violent side, my love
  It stained my skin, my love
  And it crushed my lungs like a nuclear wind
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  Paramount is my addiction,
  My skin cracks as horses pull on the leather ropes
  Brain chemistry or profound desire 
  My will alone won't save me
  \endverse

  \beginverse  
  You loiter at the bottom of the sky
  Like death at the bottom of my heart
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
  Among the green parks \& the distant fields
  I see my Paramount escaping from my misty eyes…
  \endchorus
