\beginsong{Vanity Rewinds}[by={Other Lies}]

  \chordsoff
  \beginverse
  As the future is unclear and escapes unseen
  I can’t see the exit, open wide and clear
  Still an obscure dream with the words I mean
  I can see your future is full of tears
  \endverse
  
  \beginchorus
  And now I see the moon’s shine desire
  With my new friend eternity
  The unreal dream unravels
  And at this time vanity rewinds
  \endchorus
  
  \beginverse
  It’s the usual scene, the same moves obscene 
  And the worse I have seen
  Still little compared to the actual things
  From now on My life is useless and belongs to thee
  \endverse
  
  \beginchorus
  And now I see the moon’s shine desire
  With my new friend eternity
  Before the beautiful and clean,
  There is this time when my vanity rewinds 
  \endchorus
  
  \textnote{Solo}

  \beginverse
  Don’t be scared my darlin’ sweet in this world obscene
  I can see the things that leave you crying, 
  When the poison evaporates
  We will wake up from that bad hippy dream
  \endverse
