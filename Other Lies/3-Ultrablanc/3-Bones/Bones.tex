  \beginchorus
  \lilypondfile[nofragment]{Bones-Chorus-1.ly}  
  Now I can feel it in my bones,
  I really know where I belong
  With my naked soul in front of all,
  I know where I went wrong
  \endchorus
  
  \beginverse
  For sure I mistook
  The empty places for a royal court
  And my small steps for great endeavours
  And I just confused my mess with the complex
  Smothered by the tides of my pride
  \endverse
  
  \beginchorus
  \lilypondfile[nofragment]{Bones-Chorus-2.ly}  
  Now I can feel it in my bones,
  Have to confess I lost control
  Now my body is lost for good for all
  But I know where I went wrong \rep{2}

  \beginchorus
  Now I can feel it in my bones,
  This holy fire burns my soul!
  Pulverized by some unknown forces,
  I know where I went wrong \rep{2}
