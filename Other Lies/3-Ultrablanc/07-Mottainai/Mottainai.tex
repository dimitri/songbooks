  \beginverse
  I could have lost myself for you 
  Watching my footsteps in the desert sand of my past
  I was meant to shine for you, for you !
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
  And I alone was burning out but our future is a foreign country to you! To you!
  \endchorus

  \beginverse  
  They treated us like children
  And managed our lives in our stead, 
  Making us believe paradise is down here,
  Turning us into some arrogant demons  
  And I was burning off for you
  But our future was a foreign country to you! 
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
  I have burnt myself its true, but It  was meant for you!
