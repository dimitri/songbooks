  \beginverse
  \lilypondfile[nofragment]{verse.ly}

  Is it the way it was supposed to start?
  It’s chasing me till the heart of the night 
  Is it the smell in the air?
  Or the sounds in this garden?
  I feel strangely aroused tonight
  I can’t find any sleep
  \& I could not find anyone
  But I know something is about to happen
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
  \lilypondfile[nofragment]{chorus-1.ly}

  I can feel something inside, feeling it alive
  And all my life seems now passing by
  With all its fun and sad and dreary times 
  Do you start to feel that thing I feel inside?
  Am I about to lose myself or just turn mad?
  \endchorus

  \beginverse  
  \lilypondfile[nofragment]{verse.ly}

  My world is an exit sign,
  I just can’t avoid it tonight  
  The pure view \& the speed are drying my eyes 
  Tonight I leave it all behind,
  Tonight I will cross the sky 
  And I cannot hide behind “All ends are sad”
  I  must Feel it all, feel it all the way,
  Feel it all, feel it till I faint
  Until this gross thing is falling apart
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
  \lilypondfile[nofragment]{chorus-2.ly}

  Now I am crossing the clouds gate,
  Far into the sky I kill my past
  And no one is left behind
  Steping on blue doorway of the silent city,
  Destroyed by the cold light of days,
  I rebuild my new self tonight
  The invisible king’s city murmurs
  ‘it’s ok to rebuild yourself but its not your time!’
  \endchorus

  \beginverse  
  And no one holds my hand,
  The dawn is strangely sparkling and whispers
  “some angels are made of magic and fire”
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  \lilypondfile[nofragment]{outro-1.ly}
  
  Tonight I know I’ll never sleep again,
  Haunted by this irreversible thing of my life
  Saying this impossible goodbye left me wondering
  “Is there anyone left for me god?”
  With my thin flow of air,
  With my fragile piece of flesh 
  Only love still bounds me to some strange places on earth
  
  Will my flag stand in here forever?
  \endverse
