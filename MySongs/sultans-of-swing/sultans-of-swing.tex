  \beginverse
  You get a shiver in the dark,
  It's a raining in the park but meantime
  South of the river you stop
  And you hold everything
  A band is blowing Dixie, double four time
  You feel alright
  When you hear the music ring
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  Well now you step inside
  But you don't see too many faces
  Coming in out of the rain
  They hear the jazz go down
  Competition in other places
  Uh but the horns they blowin' that sound
  Way on down south
  Way on down south
  London town
  \endverse

  \textnote{Instrumental}

  \beginverse
  You check out guitar George,
  He knows all the chords
  Mind it's strictly rhythm
  He doesn't want to make it cry or sing
  They said an old guitar is all he can afford
  When he gets up under the lights
  To play his thing
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  And Harry doesn't mind,
  If he doesn't make the scene
  He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright
  He can play the Honky Tonk like anything
  Savin' it up for Friday night
  With the Sultans
  With the Sultans of Swing
  \endverse

  \textnote{Instrumental}

  \beginverse
  Then a crowd a young boys
  They're a foolin' around in the corner
  Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies
  And their platform soles
  They don't give a damn
  About any trumpet playin' band
  It ain't what they call Rock and Roll
  And the Sultans
  Yeah, the Sultans, they play Creole
  Creole
  \endverse

  \textnote{Instrumental, Solo 1}

  \beginverse
  And then the man he steps right
  Up to the microphone
  And says at last just as the time bell rings
  "Goodnight, now it's time to go home"
  Then he makes it fast with one more thing
  We are the Sultans
  We are the Sultans of Swing
  \endverse
