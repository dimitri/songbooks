  \beginverse
  \[C]I am just a poor boy
  Though my story's \[C/B]seldom \[Am]told
  I have \[G]squandered my resistance
  For a \[G7]pocketful of \[G6]mumbles
  Such are \[C]promises
  All \[C/B]lies and \[Am]jest
  Still a \[G]man hears what he \[F]wants to hear
  And disregards the \[C]rest \[G] \[F] \[G] \[C]
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  When I \[C]left my home and my family
  I was no more \[C/B]than a \[Am]boy
  In the \[G]company of strangers
  In the \[G7]quiet of the \[G6]railway station
  \[C]Running scared
  Laying \[Am]low, seeking \[G]out the poorer \[F]quarters
  Where the ragged people \[C]go
  Looking \[G]for the places \[F]only \[G]they would \[C]know
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
  Lie-la-\[Am]lie
  Lie-la-\[Em]lie-lie-lie-lie-lie
  Lie-la-\[Am]lie
  Lie-la-\[G]lie-lie-lie-lie-lie, lie-lie-lie-lie-\[C]lie
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
  Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job
  But I get no offers
  Just a come-on from the whores on 7th Avenue
  I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome
  I took some comfort there, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
  Lie-la-lie
  Lie-la-lie-lie-lie-lie-lie
  Lie-la-lie
  Lie-la-lie-lie-lie-lie-lie, lie-lie-lie-lie-lie
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
  Then I'm \[C]laying out my winter clothes
  And wishing \[C/B]I was \[Am]gone, going \[G]home
  Where the \[G7]New York City \[G6]winters aren't \[C]bleeding me
  \[Em]Leading m\[Am]e, going \[G7]home \[C]
  \endverse

  \beginverse
  In the clearing stands a boxer
  And a fighter by his trade
  And he carries the reminders
  Of every glove that laid him down
  Or cut him till he cried out
  In his anger and his shame
  "I am leaving, I am leaving"
  But the fighter still remains
  \endverse
